## Usage

Add `rituals` to your `dev-requirements.txt` or a similar file,
or add it to `setup_requires` in your `setup.py`.
Then at the start of your `tasks.py`, use the following statement to define _all_ tasks that are considered standard:

```py
from rituals.invoke_tasks import *
```

Of course, you can also do more selective imports, or remove specific tasks from the standard set via `del`.

To refer to the current GitHub ``master`` branch, use a ``pip`` requirement like this:

```
-e git+https://github.com/jhermann/rituals.git#egg=rituals
```


## Contributing

invoke build --docs
```

To use the source in this working directory within another project,

and either call ``pip install -e .`` or ``python setup.py develop -U``.
