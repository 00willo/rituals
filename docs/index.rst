Welcome to the “Rituals” manual!
================================

Overview
--------

“Rituals” is a task library for `Invoke <http://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_
that keeps the most common tasks you always need out of your project,
and makes them centrally maintained. This leaves your ``tasks.py`` small
and to the point, with only things specific to the project at hand.

For more information, continue with the :doc:`usage`.
